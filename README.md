Least arbitrary way of measuring urban population is the ONS 2011 methodology for
defining built-up areas by contiguous urban sprawl rather than arbitrary city boundaries
(Manchester as a case in point)
Unfortunately, the 2021 census data does not contain an equivalent geography so will use 2011 methodology.

Get 2011 BUA data from the following link:
https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs104ew
Choose "England and Wales" as area and use "built-up areas" as Type of area.


Equivalent Scottish data for Mid-2012 population 
Use Table 2a CSV: Estimated population of settlements by broad age groups, mid-2012
